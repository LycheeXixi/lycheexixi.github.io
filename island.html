            Brief:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            This project is an immersive VR car exhibition that I created during the pandemic. The whole car exhibition is divided into three showrooms, A, B and C. There are four big screens in room A, and each screen introduced knowledge about cars. Room B displays some very famous car models in the world and their profiles. In room C, visitors can not only view the model and parameters of a particular car, but also interact with the car model, such as turning the steering wheel, changing the colour, opening the doors and lights.

            Theory Support:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            Due to the pandemic of covid-19 these years, most of the museums and exhibitions are opening online (King, Smith, Wilson and Williams, 2021), which provides theory support for this project. I intended to build an online VR car exhibition to solve the problem that people cannot visit physical museums and exhibitions during that time. At the same time, interactive technology can make people feel more immersive and have better experiences (van Dijk, Lingnau and
            Kockelkorn, 2012), which means the engagement of users could be increased by using interactions, Virtual Reality (VR) is a kind of typical immersive technology that is known by many people. These are theory supports for me to continue working on this project.
