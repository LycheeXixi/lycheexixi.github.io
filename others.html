           This interactive whale museum contains two main parts, exhibitions, and games. Through the undersea corridors, the exhibition is located in the central area on the first floor, which includes a big timeline, a climate change introduction, the role of whales in the carbon cycle, and why and how you should care about whales. In addition to those exhibitions, the whale gallery and a simple team introduction are also set on the first floor. There are 4 whale-themed games on the second-floor mystery spherical rooms, described further on. The user begins the experience in a small tutorial corridor outside, curving around one bend with flashing waypoint arrows to make sure by the time
            they enter the main building, they have a rough grasp of the WASD walking, camera head movements and ‘E’ as interactions as set up by a small puzzle-piece system of
            pieces around the walls of the museum, encouraging the user to explore and providing a satisfying end to work towards.
