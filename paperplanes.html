            Paper Planes is a group project that combines user experience (UX) design and business innovation. It has
            previously won the Best Entrepreneurial Team Award at the EIT Digital Summer School Programme themed
            e-Health: Personalised Prevention in Tallinn on July 2023.

        <div class="project-text">
            Paper Planes is a diary application that allows people, especially those with depression to write down and
            track their daily emotions and activities.

        <div class="project-subtitle">
            Current Situation & Problem:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            Depression has a high global prevalence. However, there are problems in the treatment of depression, the
            most significant being the lack of active participation of the patient in the treatment process, lack of
            information from clinicians and patient dropout. Therefore, encouraging patients to regularly use mental
            health apps and record their health data is crucial for the treatment.
        </div>
        <div class="project-subtitle">
            Main Features:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            There are three main features of our product that ensure that it motivates people with depression to record
            their health data while facilitating the treatment of patients by clinicians.
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">

                <li class="project-list">
                    <strong>Integration of health data from external applications.</strong> Many patients experience
                    somatic symptoms such as sleep disturbances, appetite disorders or fatigue [1]. In order to assess
                    the patient's health in a more comprehensive way, Paper Planes can easily obtain data on the user's
                    exercise, sleep or diet from external apps such as Apple Health.

                <li class="project-list">
                    <strong>AI-generated report on each patient for doctors.</strong> Using the patient's record of
                    their own health data, as well as other externally imported health data, Paper Planes uses
                    artificial intelligence to analyse their mood and activity to generate a comprehensive report for
                    their doctor, which gives them a more specific and comprehensive understanding of the patient's
                    condition.

                <li class="project-list">
                    <strong>AI-generated personalised images for diaries.</strong> The app uses advanced natural
                    language processing and image generation techniques to transform each of the patient's diary entries
                    into an image. These images not only serve as a way to motivate patients to record their emotions,
                    but also help them understand their emotions better.

            Persona:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            Based on the problems and after doing a few interviews with some people with depression or anxiety, we
            created a persona named Liisbeth, who is a young woman. Liisbeth since her teenage years has suffered from
            anxiety and depression, several times she went to a
            doctor, with whom she started a therapeutic path. She changed a lot over time, but always felt dissatisfied
            with the therapist and was never willing to open up fully.
            On the other side, doctors miss out on a lot of information about their patients and it’s difficult to
            understand what makes them feel happy and keep track of their progress over time.

            Competitive Analysis:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            The top competitors that we have defined were Daylio, Bearable, and DailyBean. The three applications had their own strengths and specialised functions. Daylio and Dailybean were focused on writing journals and more on the features that you can build up yourself, while Bearable was focused on the analytics and the statistics of the data that you input in the app such as which activities or who makes you happy. Daylio and Bearable were capable of exporting a file from the data, which made it easier for the user to share their data with their therapist or doctor.

        <div class="project-subtitle">
            Business Model:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            The key partners in our business model are physicians and clinics for validation and for making sure our
            business gets funding for initial growth and launch.
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            Key activities to develop the business are constant application development and convincing doctors and clinics to use our application, making it capable of getting on a path where doctors recommend us to other doctors. 
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            The key proposition that makes the business remarkable is that the app shows the emotional trend path over time in a user friendly interface. AI generated images are provided to the users who input their data through writing journals. The app also provides sharing relevant data of the patients to the doctor, making it easier for the doctors and clinics to provide more personal and effective treatments.
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            For the business to start, it needs developers to develop the app. Also it would need storages and drives for the user to save their data. Research and development would be needed ahead from launching the app. Open AI apps would need to be powering our app to do a significant function. Also marketing and campaigns would be needed as well. For marketing, the business will be introduced to some clinics for free or by paying them at first, just for validation. We will contact social platforms such as huge psychology influencers in SNS. 
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            To manage all the fees for the business, revenue streams are necessary. We came up with various revenue streams for the seed funding which mainly include EU seed funding and the “Estonian minister of social affairs for innovation funding”. As the business gains real shape and functions, more revenue models will be included, such as freemium services, in-app purchases, subscription as short term pricing mechanisms, and a bundle payment for the long term revenue model.

            Go-to-market Strategy:
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            The go-to-market strategy for Paper Planes focuses on the Estonian market and targets the three main customer segments that we identified: mental health doctors, mental health clinics and the general public. For these three customer segments we selected three slightly different pricing strategies and different communication channels.
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            Private mental health doctors are the main target for Paper Planes. In particular the target will be younger doctors in the age group 30-50 who are more likely to try out new technological solutions. Doctors will be able to purchase the premium version of Paper Planes at the price of 3.99€/month per patient. They will then be provided with the possibility to generate codes and links to share the application access with their patients. 
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            Private clinics are the secondary target for Paper Planes’ strategy. They will be able to purchase Paper Planes at the price of 3000€/month independently from the number of patients. For smaller clinics, with a small number of doctors, the pricing strategy will instead be the same that is used for private doctors. All the doctors of the clinic will then have access to the advantages of Paper Planes.
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            Our plan is to promote the application to doctors and clinics by contacting them directly through email or social media, and schedule offline or online meetings with them to introduce them to Paper Planes and the advantages of using the service.
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            The general public is the third market segment that the company will target. No marketing effort will be made to reach the general public, but the interest of people in mental health or keeping a diary and hearing about it from others may convince them to download the application. Targeting the general public will give the possibility to generate further revenues with a small cost. 
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            The application will be available for free with limited features, the premium version will instead be available at the price of 4.99€/month.

        <div class="project-text">
            Paper Planes will be distributed online as a downloadable application for both personal computers and mobile devices. The desktop version for doctors will be available for download on Paper Planes’ website, while the application for patients will be available on both the Google Play Store and the App Store. A free trial of the duration of one week will be available for the general public, while for doctors and clinics a free trial of three months will be available with a limited number of  patients.
