            Inspiration: 
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
            For this work, our inspiration is the article <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210119-why-saving-whales-can-help-fight-climate-change">“How whales help cool the earth”</a>, which explains how whales help the earth, why they are helpful and significant to the earth and whaling brings serious consequences to the ecological environment (Yeo, 2021). Our project is an interactive museum with the theme of whales to popularize the knowledge about whales and whaling. At the same time, we made games related to the content and theme of the article, which were placed in the game rooms of the museum.

            Brief: 
        </div>
        <div class="project-text">
           This interactive whale museum contains two main parts, exhibitions, and games. Through the undersea corridors, the exhibition is located in the central area on the first floor, which includes a big timeline, a climate change introduction, the role of whales in the carbon cycle, and why and how you should care about whales. In addition to those exhibitions, the whale gallery and a simple team introduction are also set on the first floor. There are 4 whale-themed games on the second-floor mystery spherical rooms, described further on. The user begins the experience in a small tutorial corridor outside, curving around one bend with flashing waypoint arrows to make sure by the time
            they enter the main building, they have a rough grasp of the WASD walking, camera head movements and ‘E’ as interactions as set up by a small puzzle-piece system of
            pieces around the walls of the museum, encouraging the user to explore and providing a satisfying end to work towards.

            The 3D model of the building was made by Maya, and the whole interactive museum experience was developed using Unity Engine (C# programming).
